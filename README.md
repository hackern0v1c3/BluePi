# CanaryPi
Startup project to create a simple to deploy honey pot style detection tool for alerting on common network attacks

# Plan
I'm hoping to take some pre-existing tools and techniques for detecting common network attacks, like responder and port scanning, and package them in an easy to deploy tool with a simple interface.  I'm hoping this will help small IT teams that can't afford fancy security tools.
